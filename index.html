		    <section><h1>Putting the science back in data science</h1>
                        <h2>Advanced computation for Data Science,
		            Southern Connecticut University</h2>

			<aside class='notes'>The scientific method
                            meets modern industrial development
                            methodologies: we need to use agile
                            methods for science, specially data
                            science.
                            It started with a (seemingly) simple
                            problem: I wanted to fix a LaTeX error in
                            an ArXiV paper (which allows you to submit
                            new versions). Well, just edit it away and
                            you're done.
                            Or maybe not. The paper was written using
                            Pweave. It allows you to mix Python code
                            with LaTeX, including the data processing
                            workflow into the paper itself. Great,
                            right? Well, yes, but you need to install
                            the Python toolchain to generate it.
                            And this was not specified:
                            `requirements.txt` was missing.
                            Trial and error, you finally obtain all
                            the tools (and I need to put them into the
                            requirements.txt).
                            But then the file was missing, and I
                            needed to download it. And I didn't know
                            where to find it... I needed to look it
                            up... But then, I didn't have our own data
                            file, and when I found one, I wasn't sure
                            it was the last version...
                            Long story short: I managed to do
                            it. But if this has happened in a company,
                            and this was a production application, I'd
                            be fired. Yet this happens in science, all
                            the time. In this talk I'd like to propose
                            some ways to make it a bit better.

                                has many problems. Funding, of course, is
                                one. Attracting talent in computer science is
                                another. With all computer science jobs in
                                high demand, it's almost impossible ot attract
                                anyone to low wages and uncertain
                                career. That uncertainty carries also mental
                                health problem, which are aggravated by the
                                managerial style of many people. But, over
                                all, we have a data problem. I have
                                been reviewing half a million projects lately,
                                and they have a section devoted to IP and data
