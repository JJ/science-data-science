			<aside class='notes'>The scientific method
                            meets modern industrial development
                            methodologies: we need to use agile
                            methods for science, specially data
                            science.
                            It started with a (seemingly) simple
                            problem: I wanted to fix a LaTeX error in
                            an ArXiV paper (which allows you to submit
                            new versions). Well, just edit it away and
                            you're done.
                            Or maybe not. The paper was written using
                            Pweave. It allows you to mix Python code
                            with LaTeX, including the data processing
                            workflow into the paper itself. Great,
                            right? Well, yes, but you need to install
                            the Python toolchain to generate it.
                            And this was not specified:
                            `requirements.txt` was missing.
                            Trial and error, you finally obtain all
                            the tools (and I need to put them into the
                            requirements.txt).
                            But then the file was missing, and I
                            needed to download it. And I didn't know
                            where to find it... I needed to look it
                            up... But then, I didn't have our own data
                            file, and when I found one, I wasn't sure
                            it was the last version...
                            Long story short: I managed to do
                            it. But if this has happened in a company,
                            and this was a production application, I'd
                            be fired.
